### Getting started
   Step 1 - Go to https://github.com/FredGH/Frogger and download the Zip from gothub.
   Step 2 - Then, start index.html
   Step 3 - To play: choose automatic or manual mode. If the latter, use the arrow keys to move the player on the canvas.

### The Game Rules
   1. The game can run automatically or be played by a user. A combo at the top enable for the selection mode.
   2. When the player is hit by a bug, then the message "You have lost" is printed on the screen.
   When the player succeeds, then "You have won" is printed.
   3. When selected in mode auto, there the player figure is able to avoid enemies
   when getting to close to them and move away to avoid collision.
   4. The player is not able to move off the canvas (whether in manual or auto mode).
   5. A player collision reset the game (in both mode).

### Improvements
   1. Adjustment of the  player's displacement so it moves one box per input (when in mannal mode).
   2. Minor syntax bug fixes
   3. Modification of the ReadMe.md file
